# Deploying the Boardroom API to Railway

The `apps/api` Fastify service runs as the **`api`** service inside the
provisioned **`ig-board`** Railway project (`production` environment). It serves
both the public API probes and the static **web app** (`apps/web/out`: `/`,
`/login`, `/_next/*`, …), so a single live URL satisfies every check. Only the
authenticated API surface — `/me` and any future `/api/*` — requires a valid
Supabase JWT (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`); missing/invalid tokens get a
`401`. The web app is public and its client-side guard redirects unauthenticated
visitors to `/login`.

- `GET /health`  → `200 {"status":"ok",...}` — public.
- `GET /version` → `200 {"sha":"<git sha>", ...}` — public; the deployed `main` HEAD.
- `GET /ready`   → `200 {"ready":<bool>,"checks":{"authSecret","supabaseAdmin","anthropic"}}` — public; non-secret booleans confirming the vault-provisioned server env is bound (no values). `anthropic` (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, a later mission) is informational and never gates `ready`.
- `GET /me`      → `200 {"id","role"}` — authenticated; `role` is `founder` or `board`.

## Auth secrets (server-only, from the vault)

JWT verification needs the project's **JWT secret** as a Railway service variable
(sourced from the vault — never committed):

| Variable                    | Purpose                                            |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `SUPABASE_URL`              | Supabase project URL for server-side admin ops.    |
| `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`       | HMAC key used to verify Supabase HS256 JWTs.       |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Server-only privileged key; never sent to clients. |

These are set as `api`-service variables on the `ig-board` project, provisioned
from the vault (only the non-secret provision summary — names, project/service —
is referenced in-repo; values never are). The full name reference, including the
client-side `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and the later `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, lives in
[`docs/env.md`](docs/env.md).

Without `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` the auth boundary fails closed: `/health` and
`/version` still serve, but every authenticated route (e.g. `/me`) returns `401`.
`apps/api/src/auth.js` reads these from `process.env` only; no value is ever
hardcoded, logged, or returned in a response body.

## How the service is wired

| Concern        | Value                                                             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project        | `ig-board` (`production` env)                                     |
| Service        | `api`                                                             |
| Public domain  | `ig-board-production.up.railway.app` → container port **8080**    |
| Build          | `railway.json` → NIXPACKS, `buildCommand: npm run build` → `scripts/build.mjs` (stamps the deployed SHA, then builds the bonus web static export to `apps/web/out`; both steps non-fatal so the API always deploys) |
| Start          | `node apps/api/src/server.js` (binds `process.env.PORT`)          |
| Healthcheck    | `/health` (see `railway.json`)                                    |
| Version source | `RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` (GitHub deploys) or `GIT_COMMIT_SHA` var |

`apps/api/src/version.js` resolves the SHA from the first non-empty of
`RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`, `GIT_COMMIT_SHA`, `SOURCE_VERSION`, `GIT_SHA`, then the
build-time `apps/api/build-info.json`, then `"unknown"`. When the service is
GitHub-connected, Railway injects `RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` automatically and no
manual step is needed. For an imperative `railway up` deploy (no Git metadata),
set `GIT_COMMIT_SHA` to the deployed commit so `/version` stays accurate.

The web static export is a *bonus* served from the same service; the
acceptance-critical surface is the API. So `scripts/build.mjs` treats a
web-build failure as **non-fatal** — it logs the failure loudly, still stamps
`/version`, and lets the deploy proceed API-only. The server fails closed for a
missing export (serves a JSON index at `/`, logs `web export: NOT FOUND` at
boot), so `/health`, `/version`, and `/me` stay healthy while operators fix the
web build to restore `/login`.

## Deploy (imperative, from a clean checkout of `main`)

Requires the Railway CLI authenticated via `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` (never commit it).

```bash
# From the repo root, on the commit you want live (working tree clean):
scripts/deploy-railway.sh
```

The script links the `ig-board` project's `api` service, stamps the current
`HEAD` SHA into the `GIT_COMMIT_SHA` service variable, and runs `railway up`.
Railway builds with NIXPACKS, runs the `/health` healthcheck, and routes the
`ig-board-production` domain to port 8080.

Any of the server-side variables below that are present in the deploy
environment (sourced from the vault) are bound onto the `api` service in the same
run, each piped via `--stdin` so the value never lands in argv, logs, or the
repo. Absent ones are skipped, leaving the current value untouched:

| Variable                    | Consumer                              | Absent →                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `SUPABASE_URL`              | `supabaseAdmin.js` (admin ops)        | admin ops fail closed          |
| `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`       | `auth.js` (JWT verify)                | `/me` stays `401`              |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | `supabaseAdmin.js` (admin ops)        | admin ops fail closed          |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`         | analyst features (later mission)      | analyst features unavailable   |

The client-only `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is deliberately **not** set on the `api`
service — the server reaches Supabase with the service-role key, and the anon key
path is client-side only (see [`docs/env.md`](docs/env.md)).

No tokens, service-role keys, or Anthropic keys are stored in this repo or in
any deploy artifact — only public URLs and non-secret identifiers.
